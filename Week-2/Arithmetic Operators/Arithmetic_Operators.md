# Arithmetic Operators

> Symbol for performing operations in Java is called a "operator." As an example, +, -, *, /, etc. can be used. As well as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, the Java arithmetic operators can be used. Essentially, they are mathematical operations of the most basic kind.

- Example 1

```java
//Source Code

public class DevIncept{  
	public static void main(String args[])
	{  
		int a = 10;  
		int b = 5;  
		System.out.println(a+b);
		System.out.println(a-b);
		System.out.println(a*b);
		System.out.println(a/b);
		System.out.println(a%b);
	}
}
```

```java
//Output

15
5
50
2
0
```

- Example 2

```java
//Source Code

public class DevIncept
{  
	public static void main(String args[])
	{  
		System.out.println(10*10/5+3-1*4/2);  
	}
}
```

```java
//Output

21
```
