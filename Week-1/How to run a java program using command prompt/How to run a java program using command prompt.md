There are four platforms of the Java programming language(Java Platform Standard Edition (Java SE),Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE),Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME),JavaFX) but we will be using Java SE.

Choose a download link based on the configuration of your device(I use Windows-64 bit version and hence I chose this).
